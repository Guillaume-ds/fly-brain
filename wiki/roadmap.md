# Roadmap

## Current vision (see `decisions.md` #13)

A fly colony survives (and reproduces) against spider/food pressure that a
human, via an LLM translator, can dial up or down. Not a building game —
see #13 for why that was dropped.

## Status

| Piece | Status |
|---|---|
| Connectome data access (`fly_brain/data.py`) | done |
| Connectome exploration (`analyze`, `simulate` commands) | done |
| `world/env.py` — continuous spawn-rate params + threat movement | done, tested (`decisions.md` #14, #15) |
| `fly_brain/circuit.py` — trainable LIF circuit over real connectome | done, tested |
| `fly_brain/agent.py` — `EscapeAgent` wiring circuit into the world | done, integration-tested (untrained weights) |
| `training/curriculum.py` — stage configs | done (stage 1 only) |
| `training/trainer.py` / `training/run.py` — ES training loop | done, mechanically tested |
| Stage 1 training run (clean escape) | **unblocked and verified** — real `population_reward_std` every iteration (`decisions.md` #15); 15-iteration smoke test only, a longer real run is still future work |
| `director/` — swappable LLM world-controller layer | done; registry → rule-based controller → `Environment` verified end to end; `ClaudeController` built to spec but **not tested live** (no API credentials in this environment) — see `decisions.md` #16 |
| Reproduction mechanic (offspring = parent gains + ES perturbation, survival = selection) | designed in #13, not implemented — **current focus** |
| Stage 2 / stage 3 (noisy escape, forage transfer) | not started |
| REINFORCE implementation (comparison to ES) | not started |
| Open-world / random generation / distinct trap types, spiderweb v2 mechanic | not started, explicitly deferred (`decisions.md` #9) |
| Frontend: FastAPI+WebSocket backend, Next.js/TypeScript + Phaser 3 rendering | **decided** (`decisions.md` #19), not started — deliberately deferred until the core Python game loop works end to end |

## Immediate next steps, in order

1. ~~`world/env.py`: continuous spawn-rate parameters~~ done.
2. ~~Re-run stage-1 ES training, confirm real fitness variance~~ done —
   see `decisions.md` #15.
3. ~~`director/`: the swappable LLM world-controller layer~~ done —
   registry + `RuleBasedController` verified end to end. **Still needed:
   a live test of `ClaudeController` with a real API key** (not possible
   in this environment).
4. Reproduction mechanic from #13.

## After that

- Stage 2: same environment, harder/noisier threat signal.
- Stage 3: freeze stage-2 weights, add and train a new foraging pathway,
  combine via the override rule from `decisions.md` #5.
- REINFORCE implementation, compared against ES on the same stage-1 task.
- **Open-ended world** — replace the fixed-size grid with true open-ended,
  randomly-generated terrain, plus the spiderweb v2 mechanic (spiders drop
  webs on death; web = distinct immobilize effect, not instant death).
  Comes only after the above is proven out (`decisions.md` #9).
- **Frontend** — FastAPI+WebSocket backend, Next.js/TypeScript + Phaser 3
  rendering (`decisions.md` #19). Only after the core Python game loop
  (reproduction mechanic, a live director loop) works end to end.
